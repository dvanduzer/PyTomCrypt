- Add cipher modes: EAX (page 46), PCB(50), CCM(53), and GCM(56)

- Make sure I'm calling *_done on everything when it gets dealocated as they may be leaking memory.

- Decide how to do implement the several different mac modes.
	1. A class for each one.
	2. A class for the hmac, and a class for all the rest (cipher based)
	3. One class for all of them specifying the mode with a kwarg:
		x = MAC('key', mode='omac', cipher='aes')
		def hmac(hash, key):
			return MAC(key, mode='hmac', hash=hash)


- aes_enc.o comes from compiling aes.c with a macro defined.
	- make a aes_enc.o which simple defines ENCRYPT_ONLY and includes aes.c
	- should be in a src directory seperate from the main libtomcrypt

- cleanup the test output so it is easier to see at a glance what is going on
	- consider using unittest module

- write documentation
	- with doctest!
