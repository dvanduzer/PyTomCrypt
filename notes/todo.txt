- Add cipher modes: EAX (page 46), PCB(50), CCM(53), and GCM(56)

- cleanup the test output so it is easier to see at a glance what is going on
	- consider using unittest module

- write documentation
	- with doctest!

- decide if the RSAKey constructor will take a bit size or byte size.
	for bit size:
		This is what everyone thinks in.
		Makes it easier for us to work with non mod 8 keys. (Because we aren't
		 lulled into a false sense of security)
	for byte size:
		This is what tomcrypt actually works with internally.

- RSAKey constructor should take the string version.

- Figure out what is up with the constant which contols error handling. See
if I can get it to just error and not throw anything.
	setting ARGTYPE to 4 SHOULD result in errors being returned.
